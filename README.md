# bi-fmt

To quote the original bi-format: "Simple Structured Human-Readable Binary Format."
This is just a typescript based parser and it aims to give a relatively ok experience with this format inside of javascript projects that would like to use something that isn't JSON but don't want to fully buy into completely binary formats which might not be human readable.

This project is inspired by [tsoding/bi-format](https://github.com/tsoding/bi-format) though it isn't fully faithful to the spec provided it attempts to be a *mostly* faithful implementation of said spec.


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```


This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.17. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
